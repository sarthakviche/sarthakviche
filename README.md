# 👋 Hi, I’m Sarthak  

I’m a **B.Tech student** passionate about building things that are useful, practical, and a little bit creative. Most of the apps and projects I work on are inspired by problems I face in real life — I build solutions first for myself, and then for others.  

## 🚀 What I Do  
- 💻 **Web and App Development** – Creating responsive and functional websites and apps.  
- 🤖 **AI & Machine Learning** – Exploring data-driven solutions and building ML-powered apps.  

## 📂 Projects & Work  
Check out my repositories to see the apps I’ve built — from small utilities to larger projects that combine web + AI. I try to keep my code clean, documented, and beginner-friendly.
